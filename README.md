# Page replacement
Page replace simulation: FIFO, LRU, LFU, OPT

:large_blue_diamond: FIFO This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.

:large_blue_diamond: In Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a Greedy algorithm where the page to be replaced is least recently used. The idea is based on locality of reference, the least recently used page is not likely

:large_blue_diamond: LFU In this algorithm page will be replaced which was rarest used.

:large_blue_diamond: OPT In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future.
